## Hey, everyone! I'm Joe LaRocca.

I’m a current MS Biostatistics student (graduating in May 2026) at Columbia University with strong experience in:
- Statistical modeling and inference (R)
- Data analysis and visualization
- Applied machine learning (Python)
- Working with messy, real-world datasets

I’m particularly interested in data analytics roles in sports, health, and research-driven organizations.
